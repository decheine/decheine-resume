# My Personal Website

Designed to showcase my work in a one-pager.

URL: https://decheine.github.io/decheine-site

This website is built using [Hexo](https://hexo.io/docs/) and hosted via GitHub Pages.

I'll eventually fill this out. I wanted to add a simple link to a pdf file but Hexo's documentation is absolutely terrible and I would waste more time than it's worth to me figuring it out.

## Developing

Clone the repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/decheine/decheine-site.git
```

Edit the `_config.yml` file to edit or add content to the page.
